You need to submit the assignment CS3001. Sockets act as bidirectional communications channel where they are endpoints of it.sockets may communicate within the process, between different process and also process on different places. A socket is first created and then bound to an address using the bind method. An infinite loop is then entered for serving client requests. The recvfrom method receives a message from the datagram socket and returns not only the message but also the address of the source of the message.
